MEMORY MANAGEMENT
Applications dynamically allocate memory by requesting it from the system via the sbrk(int) system call, which raises the program break, extending the heap, and returning the new program break.

If new pages are required to ensure that the entire heap is accessible, new pages will be committed and mapped into the address space

The stack expands downwards as the heap goes upwards
